# Social Network Project

## About the Project

This project involves the development of a static portfolio website designed to showcase personal or professional work in a visually appealing and organized manner. The main objective is to create a user-friendly platform that effectively displays skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers or clients.

## Key Features

- **Visual Design**: A modern, clean design that aligns with Solana's branding and aesthetic values, emphasizing speed, innovation, and security. The design will be sleek and minimalistic, using color schemes and typography that reflect the technological sophistication of the Solana blockchain.
- **Structured Layout**: The portfolio will be organized into sections such as About Me, Works, Skills, and Contact Information. Each section will be easily navigable, allowing users to find information quickly and efficiently.
- **Responsive Design**: While the portfolio lacks interactivity, it will be fully responsive, ensuring that the content is accessible and aesthetically pleasing on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
